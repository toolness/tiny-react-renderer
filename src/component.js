/**
 * The fun begins! Well, it would in a not-so-tiny renderer, but for here it’s
 * pretty straight-forward. The idea for this particular implementation came
 * from conversations with Ryan Florence and Michael Jackson from the React
 * Router/React.js Training teams.
 *
 * React Router supports two route configuration approaches:
 *
 * 1. ReactComponents `<Router><Route path="/" component={C} />{...}</Router>`
 * 2. Object Literal `[{path: '/', component: C}, {path: '/list', component: L}]`
 *
 * As I understand it, both approaches result in the object literal, it’s just a
 * matter of the path to get there. The question then is what would it look
 * like to write a renderer that accomplishes the ReactComponent authoring style
 * in a more elegant way?
 *
 * If you recall from our mount.js render method, the return value or callback
 * is called with the result of `component.getPublicInstance()`. We want this to
 * be the JSON representation of our route configuration.
 *
 * Below we will provide a default serialize.toJSON implementation and the bare
 * minimum required to mount and update these ReactElements.

/**
 * CONGRATULATIONS! You now understand the basics of how a React Renderer works.

 * foundational pieces. Most every renderer listed on
 * http://iamdustan.com/react-renderers has the same entry path and hooks as
 * what you just learned.
 *
 * A lot of ReactDOM and ReactNative’s source is integrating the concepts we
 * just learned in this binding layer to a host environment. From this
 * foundation you have a solid understanding of the glue. ReactCore deals with
 * details of reconciliation and transactions, while renderers are plumbing.
